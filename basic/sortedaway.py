#Write a Python function that takes two sorted arrays of integers as input and merges them into a single sorted array without using any built-in sorting functions.
#For example:
#Input:
#Array 1: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
#Array 2: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
#Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Array_1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Array_2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
