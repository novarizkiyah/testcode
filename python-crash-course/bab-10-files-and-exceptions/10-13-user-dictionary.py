# The remember_me.py example only stores one piece of information, the username. 
# Expand this example by asking for two more pieces of information about the user, 
# then store all the information you collect in a dictionary. 
# Write this dictionary to a file using json.dumps(), 
# and read it back in using json.loads(). 
# Print a summary showing exactly what your program remembers about the user.
