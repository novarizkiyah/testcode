# The final listing for remember_me.py assumes 
# either that the user has already entered their username 
# or that the program is running for the first time. 
# We should modify it in case the current user is not the person 
# who last used the program.

# Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(), 
# ask the user if this is the correct username. 
# If it's not, call get_new_username() to get the correct username.
