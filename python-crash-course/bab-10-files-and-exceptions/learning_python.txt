In Python you can make everything
It is 'easy' programming laguage
But, somehow its hard to understand
In Python you can learn anything
from machine learning, web development, etc
You can be everything
But, I can see myself grow if I continue to learn Python
That's why I love Python: make it simple, make it works!
