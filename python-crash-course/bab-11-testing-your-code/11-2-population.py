# Modify your function so it requires a third parameter, population. 
# It should now return a single string of the form City, 
# Country - population xxx, such as Santiago, Chile - population 5000000. 
# Run test_cities.py again. Make sure test_city_country() fails this time.

# Modify the function so the population parameter is optional. 
# Run the test, and make sure test_city_country() passes again.

# Write a second test called test_city_country_population() 
# that verifies you can call your function 
# with the values 'santiago', 'chile', and 'population=5000000'. 
# Run the tests one more time, and make sure this new test passes.
