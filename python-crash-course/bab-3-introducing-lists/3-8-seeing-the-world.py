# Seeing the World : Think of at least 5 places in the world you'd like to visit

# 1. store the location in a list. Make sure the list is not alphabetical order.
my_go_to_places = ['madinah', 'paris', 'gowa', 'washington', 'jogjakarta']

#2. print your list in its original order. Don't worry about printing the list neatly; just print it as a raw Python list.
print(my_go_to_places)

#3. use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list
print(sorted(my_go_to_places))

#4. show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
