#3. use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list
print(sorted(my_go_to_places))

#4. show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
print(my_go_to_places)

#5. use sorted() to print your list in reverse-alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list
print(sorted(my_go_to_places.reverse))
#6. show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again
print(my_go_to_places)
#7. Use reverse() to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its order has changed
