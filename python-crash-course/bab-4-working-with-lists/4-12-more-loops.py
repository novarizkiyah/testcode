#Chose a version of foods.py 

my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
friend_foods = my_foods[:]

#write two for loops to print each list of foods
print("My favorite foods are")
for my_food in my_foods:
    print(my_food)

print("My friend's favorite food are ")

for friend_food in friend_foods:
