# Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username

# 1. Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users

# 2. Make another list of five username called new_users. Make sure ibe ir two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list

# 3. Loop through the new_user list to see if each new username has already been used. 
# If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username.
# If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.

# 4. Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. 
# If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.
# (To do this, you'll need to make a copy of current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)
