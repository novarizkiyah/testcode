# Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a list, such as 1st and 2nd. most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3

# 1. Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list

# 2. Loop through the list

# 3. Use an if-elif-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number.
# Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th  8th 9th" and each result should be on a separate line
