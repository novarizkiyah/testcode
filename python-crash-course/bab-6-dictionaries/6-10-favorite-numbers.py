# Modify your program from Exercise 6-2 (page 102) so each person can have more than one favorite number. 
# Then print each personâ€™s name along with their favorite numbers.

favorite_numbers = {
    'nova': [1, 7, 6, 4],
    'mew': [5, 6, 1, 6, 3],
    'rina': [2, 5]
}

# Correct way to iterate over the dictionary
for name, places in favorite_places.items():  # Use .items() to get both key and value
    print(name)
