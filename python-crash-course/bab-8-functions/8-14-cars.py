#Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. 
# the function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
# It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
# Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
# such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:

# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)

# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

def build_car(manufactur, model, **user_info):
    user_info['manufacturs'] = manufactur
    user_info['models'] = model
    return user_info

car_profile = build_car('subaru', 'outback', 
                        color = 'blue', tow_package = True)
print(car_profile)
