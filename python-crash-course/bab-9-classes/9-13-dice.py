# Start with Exercise 6-4 (page 108), 
# where you used a standard dictionary to represent a glossary. 
# Rewrite the program using the OrderedDict class 
# and make sure the order of the output matches the order 
# in which key-value pairs were added to the dictionary.

# Note: In Python 3.6, dictionaries store keys in order. 
# However, this is not guaranteed to work in all versions of Python, 
# so you should still use an OrderedDict when you need key-value pairs to be stored in a particular order.
